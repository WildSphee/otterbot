Catan
 (

ˈ

), previously known as 
The Settlers of Catan
 or simply 
Settlers
, is a multiplayer 
board game
 designed by 
Klaus Teuber
. It was first published in 1995 in 
Germany
 by 
Franckh-Kosmos Verlag
 (Kosmos) as 
Die Siedler von Catan
 (
pronounced
 
[diː
 
ˈziːdlɐ
 
fɔn
 
kaˈtaːn]
). Players take on the roles of settlers, each attempting to build and develop holdings while trading and acquiring resources. Players gain victory points as their settlements grow and the first to reach a set number of victory points, typically 10, wins. The game and its many expansions are also published by Catan Studio, Filosofia, GP, Inc., 999 Games, Κάισσα (Káissa), and Devir. Upon its release, 
The Settlers of Catan
 became one of the first 
Eurogames
 to achieve popularity outside Europe.

Gameplay
[
edit
]

The hexes of the island of Catan, and the roads and settlements constructed on it

Three players in a game of 
Catan

The players in the game represent settlers establishing settlements on the fictional island of Catan. Players build 
settlements
, cities, and roads to connect them as they settle the island.
[
9
]
 The game board, which represents the island, is composed of hexagonal tiles (
hexes
) of different land types, which are laid out randomly at the beginning of each game.
[
10
]
 Newer editions of the game began to depict a fixed layout in their manual and recommend this to be used by beginners. In 2016, editions of the game were released with a conventional fixed layout board in this configuration, the hexes of which cannot be rearranged.

Players build by spending 
resources
 (wool, grain, lumber, brick, and ore, or in older versions, wood, wheat, brick, ore, and sheep.) that are depicted by these resource cards; each land type, with the exception of the unproductive desert, produces a specific resource: hills produce brick, forests produce lumber, mountains produce ore, fields produce grain, and pastures produce wool. On each player's turn, two six-sided dice are rolled to determine which hexes produce resources. Players with a settlement adjacent to a hex containing the number just rolled receive one card of the corresponding resource; cities produce two cards of the corresponding resource. For example, if a player has one city and two settlements adjacent to a grain hex, that player would take four grain resource cards if the corresponding number was rolled.

There is also a robber token, initially placed on the desert; if a player rolls 7, the robber must be moved to another hex, which will no longer produce resources until the robber is moved again. That player may also steal a resource card from another player with a settlement or city adjacent to the robber's new placement. In addition, when a 7 is rolled, all players with 8 or more resource cards must discard their choice of half of their cards, rounded down. For example, If a player has 9 resource cards, and a 7 is rolled, the player must get rid of 4 cards.

On the player's turn, the player may spend resource cards to build roads or settlements, upgrade settlements to cities (which replace existing settlements), or buy development cards. Players can trade resource cards with each other; players may also trade off-island (in effect, with the non-player bank) at a ratio of four-to-one resources for one of any other. By building settlements adjacent to ports, players may trade with the bank at three-to-one (three of any single resource type) or two-to-one (two of a specific resource) ratios, depending on the port.

The goal of the game is to reach ten victory points. Players score one point for each settlement they own and two for each city. Various other achievements, such as establishing the longest road and the largest army (by playing the most knight cards), grant a player additional victory points.

Resource cards can also be spent to buy a development card. There are five different types of development cards, including cards worth one victory point; knight cards, which allow the player to move the robber as if they had rolled a 7 (but without the remove-half rule); monopoly cards, which allow the player to steal all of any one resource from other players; road building cards, which allow the player to build two roads without paying extra resource cards; and year of plenty cards which allow the player to pick up two resource cards of their choice. 

Teuber's original design was for a large game of exploration and development in a new land.
[
11
]
 Between 1993 and 1995 Teuber and Kosmos refined and simplified the game into its current form. Unused mechanics from that design went on to be used in Teuber's following games, 
Entdecker
 and 
Löwenherz
.
 The game's first expansion, 
Catan: Seafarers
,
 adds the concept of exploration, and the combined game (sometimes known as "New Shores") is probably the closest game to Teuber's original intentions.
[
6
]

In 2020, the Board Game Analysis blog created a mathematical model to evaluate how balanced any particular board layout is, with scores ranging from 0 to 1 and lower scores being more balanced. According to that model, the beginner layout recommended in the game's manual has a balance score of 0.094. They also analyzed a board layout used in a 2016 tournament, which scored a 0.106. A sample of 100 million randomly generated board layouts formed an approximately 
normal distribution
 with the majority of boards' scores clustered around 0.25.

List of Settlers of Catan products

Plastic boat pieces from the 
Seafarers of Catan
 expansion

The base game of the Catan series, 
Catan
, is designed for 3–4 players. In 1996, an extension to allow up to six players was released for the base game.
[
13
]
 As well as extra components to accommodate more players, the expansion adds an extra building phase between turns, so that players can participate in the game outside of their own turn. Players may not trade with other players during this phase nor may they trade in with the bank (maritime trade) from their own hand.

After releasing the 5- to 6-player extension, Teuber began to publish expansions for the base game. The first, 
Seafarers of Catan
, was released in 1997;
[
13
]
 it was later retitled 
Catan: Seafarers
. 
Seafarers
 adds ships that allow players to cross sea hexes, and includes scenarios in which players explore an 
archipelago
 of islands. It also adds gold-producing hexes that allow players to take the resource of their choice.

The second major expansion to the game, 
Cities and Knights of Catan
 (later 
Catan: Cities and Knights
), was released in 1998.
[
13
]
 It adds concepts from the card game and its first expansion to 
Catan
, including Knights who must be used to defend Catan from invading barbarians, and improvements that can be bought for cities that give benefits to players. Three commodities (paper, coin, and cloth) can be produced, in addition to the original resources. A 5- to 6-player extension for 
Cities & Knights
 was released at the same time. In 2000, a book of variations for 
Settlers
 was released.

The third large expansion, 
Catan: Traders & Barbarians
, was released in 2008.
[
13
]
 
Traders & Barbarians
 collects a number of smaller scenarios, some of which have previously been published elsewhere. The set includes an official two-player variant.

A special edition of the game was released in 2005: a 10th-anniversary collector's edition of the base game and 
Cities & Knights
, with hand-painted 3D tiles and playing pieces.
[
14
]

Mayfair Games
 released a fourth edition of 
The Settlers of Catan
 in 2007, with new artwork, a locking frame, a deeper box, and an insert tray; there was also a minor rule change.
[
15
]
 Soon after its release, two changes were made to the fourth edition. The robber playing piece was changed from a black to a grey color and the soldier development card was renamed a knight. Fourth-edition versions of 
Cities & Knights
, 
Seafarers
, and the 5- to 6-player extensions were also released.
[
16
]

Catan: Explorers & Pirates
, the fourth large expansion, was released in 2013. which introduces new elements for the game including moving ships, new resources, and pirates.
[
17
]

The Catan line was rebranded in 2015 for the 20th anniversary of the series, with the original 
Settlers
 game renamed simply 
Catan
.
[

[
19
]
 which allows players to re-enact the building of the 
pyramids of Egypt

Atlantis: Scenarios and Variants
 was published in 2005. 
Atlantis
 was a boxed set which collected a number of scenarios and variants published in gaming magazines and at conventions, such as 
The Volcano
 and 
The Great River
. The set also included a deck of 
event cards
 which replaced the dice in the main game, giving it a less random spread of resource production. The event cards, which were also available as a standalone item, have since been re-released in a modified form in the 
Traders and Barbarians
 expansion.
[
22
]

Kosmos, Mayfair, and 999 Games released the first stand-alone "Catan Geographies" title,

Catan: Oil Springs
 is an expansion by Erik Assadourian and Ty Hansen
[
25
]
 introduced in 2011 designed to draw attention to environmental issues. It is offered as a free download or for purchase from the Mayfair Games website. The scenario adds oil fields that can be used to make other resources and develop metropolises, but disasters can strike if too much oil is used. Oil can also be taken out of the game, for victory points and to prevent disasters.

The scenario 
Catan: Frenemies
 was released in 2012. In 
Frenemies
, players are rewarded with redeemable "favor tokens" for "helping" their opponents by moving the robber harmlessly, giving away resources, and connecting their roads to their opponents' road networks. Depending on the circumstances, these favors might not be helpful.
[
26
]

Helpers of Catan
 is an expansion released in 2013. The computer opponent characters from the PC/Mac game 
Catan – Cities & Knights
 return in this scenario as "helper cards", which can be used during gameplay; for example, the helper card for Candamir allows the player who uses it to substitute any one resource when buying a development card.

Spinoffs and other related products
[
edit
]

The popularity of 
The Settlers of Catan
 led to the creation of spinoff games and products, starting in 1996 with 
The Settlers of Catan
 card game (later renamed to 
Catan Card Game
), and the 2003 novel, 
Die Siedler von Catan
, by German 
historical fiction
 author 
Rebecca Gablé
, which tells the story of a group of Norse seafarers who set out in search of the mythical island of Catan.

In 2002 a travel edition of 
Catan
 was published, featuring playing pieces which slot into a fixed-layout board.

In 1999, 
Starfarers of Catan
 was released. It was loosely based upon the original 
Catan
, including similar dice mechanisms for resource production as well as trading and building. However, the spin-off also introduces spaceports, spaceships, and the flight mechanism.
[

]
[
29
]

The "Catan Histories" subseries includes 
Settlers of the Stone Age
, a re-release of 
Struggle for Rome
, 
Settlers of America,
 and 
Rise of the Inkas
.

The 
Catan Dice Game
 was released in 2007. The game is played with six dice, the faces of which depict one of six resources (brick, lumber, wool, grain, ore, or gold). The dice are rolled up to three times, and the score of each roll is recorded by "building" roads, settlements, cities, and knights on a score sheet that shows a miniature version of the island of Catan. In the base game, one to four players try to get the highest score. There is also a "plus" version of the game, which, like the original 
Catan
 board game, is a race to be the first player to score 10 victory points.
[
30
]

In addition to the 
Catan Card Game
 above, two additional card game spinoffs have been published. 
Rivals for Catan
, published in 2010, is a two-player strategy game for expert players that plays like a board game, and 
The Struggle for Catan
, published in 2011, is a two- to four-player game that plays more like a card game and is suitable for Catan novices.
[
31
]
[
32
]

Catan Junior
 is a 2012 spinoff for families with children. The game is based on the original 
Settlers of Catan
 with a "pirate" theme and simpler rules. Players build "pirates' lairs" in the islands and build ships to reach new building sites. Resource and development cards are replaced with tiles, trading and building are simpler, and the "Ghost Captain" does not steal resources as the robber in the base game does.
[
33
]

Star Trek Catan
 is a spin-off of the original series released in 2012 by Mayfair Games.
[
34
]
 The game uses the same basic components with new names, new graphics, and some minor rules additions. The building costs and resources match the original game. It incorporates the "Helpers of Catan" expansion, with the cards renamed as 
Star Trek
 characters.

A Game of Thrones Catan: Brotherhood of the Watch
 is a spin-off based on 
George R. R. Martin
's 
A Song of Ice and Fire
 series. As Brothers of the Night Watch, players harvest resources from the Gift to build settlements and keeps, while contributing to the defense of the Wall.

[
36

[
38
]
 An updated set of Catanimal Sprite plushes was introduced in early 2021
[
39

 and are based on new illustrated characters by artist 
Kay O'Neill
.

Reception
[
edit
]

Pyramid
 magazine reviewed 
The Settlers of Catan
 and stated that "
The Settlers of Catan
 is a very satisfying game of economic development and trading. [...] The game takes only 1.5 to 2 hours to play, but has as much satisfaction as games that take much longer."
[
40
]

Steve Faragher reviewed 
The Settlers of Catan
 for 
Arcane
 magazine in 1996, rating it a 10 out of 10 overall, and stating that he considered it "One of the finest, most sweetly designed and hugely entertaining games you'll ever get your grubby mitts on. Only a fool wouldn't buy а copy."
[
41
]

Catan became popular in the United States, with 
The Washington Post
 calling it "the board game of our time" in 2010.
[
42
]
 American video game designer  
Richard Dansky
 described Catan as "a hardcore game and a light social pastime and everything in between".
[
43
]

A 2012 American documentary film titled 
Going Cardboard
 (featuring Klaus Teuber) is about this game's impact on American gaming communities and what came of it.

In 2020, Erica Price noted that while 
Catan
 had become "a mid to late 2010s staple in popular culture," she argued that "the one place where Catan has seen a drop in popularity over the past decade is in its first world, that of hobby board games." She attributed this decline to a "lack of innovation," as well as "a reluctance to buy into the popularity of app-supported games (though solely mobile versions of Catan exist), crowdfunding, and new mechanics."

In February 2015, 
Variety
 announced that producer 
Gail Katz
 had purchased the film and TV rights to 
The Settlers of Catan
. Katz said, "The island of Catan is a vivid, visual, exciting and timeless world with classic themes and moral challenges that resonate today. There is a tremendous opportunity to take what people love about the game and its mythology as a starting point for the narrative".

 In October 2017, 
Variety
 reported that 
Sony Pictures
 was negotiating to acquire the rights to adapt it into a film, with Gail Katz still attached to the project.

Tournaments

U.S. National Championship
[
edit
]

Every year, thousands of Americans compete at local qualifying Catan tournaments in the United States.
[
89
]
 The winners of those tournaments are then guaranteed a seat at the Catan United States National Championship.

During the 2024 Catan US National Championship, Drew Elliott, a Catan Youtuber known as 
DandyDrew
, won the final event in Saint Paul Minnesota on September 8th 2024. Drew will represent the US at the World Championships in 2025, to be held in Germany.

World Championship
[
edit
]

The first Catan World Championship was held in 2002 at the game fair "Internationalen Spieltage" in 
Essen, Germany
. It took place there every year until 2008, when it was hosted at Gen Con Indy, in the United States. Since then, the Catan World Championship has taken place every two years, with the location alternating between the United States and Germany.
[
91
]
[
92
]

In 2018, there were participants in the World Championship from over forty countries. A maximum of two players per country are allowed to participate.
[
92
]

To be eligible to compete in the World Championship, all players must be over the age of 18, as well as a citizen or permanent resident of the country in which they are competing.
[
93
]

The World Championship is structured in three rounds: the preliminary round, the semifinals, and the finals. The preliminary round consists of three games, of which the top sixteen players advance to the semifinals. The semifinals are seeded based first on wins, then points, and then the quality of victory (percentage of total points earned per game) in the preliminary round games. The winner of each semifinal game then advances to the finals. The winner of the finals becomes the Catan World Champion.
[
89
]

The 2020 championship was postponed because of the 
COVID-19 pandemic
; it was eventually held in 
Valletta
, Malta, in 2022.
